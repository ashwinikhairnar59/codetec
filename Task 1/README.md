# Task One: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Purpose
Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, key statistics, relationships, and patterns. EDA helps identify data characteristics before any modeling.

## Steps

### 1. Dataset Inspection
View the first rows and summarize the data with statistics.

### 2. Null Check
Identify missing values to determine if data cleaning is needed.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
Calculate relationships between variables to see if any features are correlated.

### 4. Visualization
Use histograms, scatter plot matrices, and heatmaps to observe distributions and relationships within the data.
