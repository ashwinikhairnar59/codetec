# Task Two: Linear Regression Model

## Purpose
In this task, we will implement a simple **linear regression model** to predict continuous target variables. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the model, evaluate its performance using key metrics like **mean squared error (MSE)** and **R-squared**, and visualize the model’s predictions to assess its accuracy.

## Steps

### 1. Dataset Split
- **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets.
- **Training Set**: Used to train the linear regression model.
- **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### 2. Model Training
- **Train the linear regression model** on the training data.
- Fit the model to the features and target variable in the training set.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluate the model's performance** using the following metrics:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
  - **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### 4. Predictions
- **Make predictions** on the test data.
- Compare the predicted values with the actual values from the test set.

### 5. Visualization
- **Visualize the regression line**: Plot the regression line on a scatter plot to show the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- **Actual vs Predicted Plot**: Plot the actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy visually.
